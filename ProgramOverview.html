                    <p>The Software Systems Developer (SSD) program (Web Programmer option) is an eight month, full-time business application development program offered by BCIT's School of Computing and Academic Studies, within the HTP department at the downtown Vancouver campus.</p>
                    <p>It prepares individuals for high-demand careers in the technical areas of web application development, programming, database and systems analysis. Students learn industry-ready skills through extensive hands-on practice in current scripting and coding techniques, object-oriented architecture patterns, application security and scalability, developer tools, and platforms for building complete web-based business applications from scratch. <br>
                    <br>
                    Graduates of this certificate program may apply for acceptance into the BCIT Bachelor of Technology in Computer Systems (additional prerequisites are required). </p>
                    <p>This program is delivered through classroom instruction, hands-on lab work and individual and team projects.</p>
                    <p>While applicants are not required to have formal computer programming experience, they need to have a solid understanding of object oriented programming as well as possess sound logical and reasoning skills. Applicants with no knowledge are advised to take a programming language course, such as introduction to object-oriented programming, C#, or Java.</p>
