                            SSDP 3501 advances software development skills that were introduced in SSDP 2501.  Theory and practice cover advanced object-oriented programming with C#, client-side scripting using Angular 4, as well as an introduction to  object-oriented server-side development for the web using ASP.NET and PHP.  MVC and component based development patterns are practiced. On completion, participants are able to develop basic interactive, data-driven web applications.

                            In addition to completing iOS development training, this course incorporates professional presentation, team collaboration, communication, and technical skills covered throughout the program with two major projects and four career preparation sessions.  Both projects challenge participants to research and assemble new software applications in teams. The first project is an internal web project which simulates an industry setting.  The second project involves a four-week term in partnership with an industry client to build a web site or web site component. Both projects require agile project management, effective systems analysis and design, communication of design and progress, source code management, and data driven development using current best practices.
